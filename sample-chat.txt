[07/01/2023, 14:10:45] Sean!!: A year flies fast
[07/01/2023, 14:10:53] Sean!!: Faster than you can realise
[07/01/2023, 14:11:16] Sean!!: One second you’re saying happy new year
[07/01/2023, 14:11:21] Sean!!: Next you’re a week in
[07/01/2023, 14:11:42] Sean!!: And now you’ve just lost 1 out of 52 weeks in the year
[07/01/2023, 14:11:47] Sean!!: Just like that
[07/01/2023, 14:17:09] Sean!!: Ask yourself why you want to improve
[07/01/2023, 14:19:15] Sean!!: What are your goals
Set them
No matter how crazy they might sound
Or how intimidating
[07/01/2023, 14:19:23] Sean!!: And take it week by week
Day by day
[07/01/2023, 14:19:34] Sean!!: Love yourself
And emerge victorious!
[07/01/2023, 14:19:38] Sean!!: Let’s go!
[07/01/2023, 14:20:04] Sean!!: From Monday, you would just drop a ✅
For each day you met your goals
[07/01/2023, 14:20:10] Dike Slime🐍: !!!
[07/01/2023, 14:20:25] Dike Slime🐍: Let’s get this bread
[07/01/2023, 14:21:50] Dike Slime🐍: So what the plan basically for cutting ? 
Or we making our own plans and dropping the ✅ if we get them done ?
[07/01/2023, 14:24:05] Sean!!: My goals are to slightly build some muscle
But shred to nearly visible abs

I am not competing, so there’s no need for me to be at low body fat levels 

Just so my face can be low on fat, my jaw to be more visible, just to be shredded so I can take a shirtless pic in the summer time

These are personal reasons and I am proud of them

So should you!
[07/01/2023, 14:25:14] Sean!!: Yes
Your path
If you need help with your stuff
It will obviously be discussed here
We will motivate each other
And confess times where we feel like losing
Just raw bro energy
[07/01/2023, 14:26:02] Sean!!: But the concept is 
When we search ✅ in the chat

It will be full, like you will scroll with the amount of ✅
[07/01/2023, 14:26:30] Sean!!: So set realistic but ambitious goals
So you meet your targets at your desired times
[07/01/2023, 16:45:33] Dike Slime🐍: Amazing
