[07/01/2023, 15:11:16] Sean 👨🏽‍🎨 Patrick Nkwo: One second you’re saying happy new year
[07/01/2023, 15:11:21] Sean 👨🏽‍🎨 Patrick Nkwo: Next you’re a week in
[07/01/2023, 15:11:43] Sean 👨🏽‍🎨 Patrick Nkwo: And now you’ve just lost 1 out of 52 weeks in the year
[07/01/2023, 15:11:47] Sean 👨🏽‍🎨 Patrick Nkwo: Just like that
[07/01/2023, 15:17:09] Sean 👨🏽‍🎨 Patrick Nkwo: Ask yourself why you want to improve
[07/01/2023, 15:19:15] Sean 👨🏽‍🎨 Patrick Nkwo: What are your goals
Set them
No matter how crazy they might sound
Or how intimidating
[07/01/2023, 15:19:23] Sean 👨🏽‍🎨 Patrick Nkwo: And take it week by week
Day by day
[07/01/2023, 15:19:34] Sean 👨🏽‍🎨 Patrick Nkwo: Love yourself
And emerge victorious!
[07/01/2023, 15:19:38] Sean 👨🏽‍🎨 Patrick Nkwo: Let’s go!
[07/01/2023, 15:20:04] Sean 👨🏽‍🎨 Patrick Nkwo: From Monday, you would just drop a ✅
For each day you met your goals
[07/01/2023, 15:20:10] Nonso 🐼 Dike: !!!

[07/01/2023, 15:21:50] Nonso 🐼 Dike: So what the plan basically for cutting ? 
Or we making our own plans and dropping the ✅ if we get them done ?
[07/01/2023, 15:24:05] Sean 👨🏽‍🎨 Patrick Nkwo: My goals are to slightly build some muscle
But shred to nearly visible abs

I am not competing, so there’s no need for me to be at low body fat levels 

Just so my face can be low on fat, my jaw to be more visible, just to be shredded so I can take a shirtless pic in the summer time

These are personal reasons and I am proud of them

So should you!
[07/01/2023, 15:25:15] Sean 👨🏽‍🎨 Patrick Nkwo: Yes
Your path
If you need help with your stuff
It will obviously be discussed here
We will motivate each other
And confess times where we feel like losing
Just raw bro energy
[07/01/2023, 15:26:02] Sean 👨🏽‍🎨 Patrick Nkwo: But the concept is 
When we search ✅ in the chat

It will be full, like you will scroll with the amount of ✅
[07/01/2023, 15:26:30] Sean 👨🏽‍🎨 Patrick Nkwo: So set realistic but ambitious goals

[09/01/2023, 09:13:58] Sean 👨🏽‍🎨 Patrick Nkwo: Yh it’ll be tough in Naij
Cuz here the calories are displayed on everything
[09/01/2023, 09:15:18] Sean 👨🏽‍🎨 Patrick Nkwo: I’d say
If you watch YouTube eating plans
They’ll show you how much they eat in a day to lose weight
Like the gym guys oh
Not random Indian special apple vinegar tea videos

Like real ones talking about their meals
[09/01/2023, 09:16:13] Sean 👨🏽‍🎨 Patrick Nkwo: But Omo it’s actually based on what you can endure
I’m 2022 I mostly ate chicken and eggs with lettuce & cabbage with bread as my carb source

And it worked out for me
[09/01/2023, 09:16:50] Sean 👨🏽‍🎨 Patrick Nkwo: But if you’re someone that gets tired of eating the same meal, it might not be so easy to run my method
[09/01/2023, 09:18:05] Sean 👨🏽‍🎨 Patrick Nkwo: I’d say watch YouTube and Tiktok for 
search 2000 calorie meal plan
Or 1800 meal plan

Or cutting diet

Or lean bull diet (if you’re looking to add muscle mass)
[09/01/2023, 09:18:48] Sean 👨🏽‍🎨 Patrick Nkwo: But I swr
If you bang out
100 push-ups & 20-30 sit-ups everyday 

For a month
You’ll not be the same person
[09/01/2023, 10:45:12] Obi Fortune: my food intake isn’t that bad tbh

[09/01/2023, 10:45:59] Obi Fortune: i was doing this for a while
i don’t mind tbh
[09/01/2023, 10:46:27] Obi Fortune: i don’t mind tbh
[09/01/2023, 10:46:43] Obi Fortune: i’m trying to lose fat
[09/01/2023, 10:46:58] Obi Fortune: i’m trying to get to that 100

[09/01/2023, 11:14:25] Sean 👨🏽‍🎨 Patrick Nkwo: Great
[09/01/2023, 11:14:39] Sean 👨🏽‍🎨 Patrick Nkwo: Just weigh yourself
Then record your current weight
[09/01/2023, 11:15:22] Sean 👨🏽‍🎨 Patrick Nkwo: Then try to eat 
At 1800-2000 calories a day
Weigh yourself at the end of the month
See if you stayed the same, reduced or added
[09/01/2023, 11:15:30] Sean 👨🏽‍🎨 Patrick Nkwo: Tweak as you go
[09/01/2023, 11:16:37] Sean 👨🏽‍🎨 Patrick Nkwo: Then, cut out bad things like frying your food in oil
Cuz oil has like 200 calories in a spoon Abi

Something in that insane ballpark 

Switch to 1 calorie spray oil
And lightly grill your food instead
[09/01/2023, 11:16:41] Sean 👨🏽‍🎨 Patrick Nkwo: That helped
[09/01/2023, 11:17:35] Harold 🔌⚡️: Drink water bro

[10/01/2023, 14:06:36] Sean 👨🏽‍🎨 Patrick Nkwo: Any motivation is good enough to start

Then to keep going
You would’ve found yourself and confidence by maintaining your vessel

And that alone will serve as motivation cuz of self love
[10/01/2023, 14:08:31] Sean 👨🏽‍🎨 Patrick Nkwo: You can use the fact that a babe did you dirty
Or they laughed at your body in school
Or that you watched anime and want to be like OPM or Baki
Or even because you want to become a personal trainer in the future
Or you want to attract one girl in your eye

Or because you want to surprise your family

Or you want to gain the respect of your father

Or want to fight for a girl in the village


Any And anything stands

[13/01/2023, 01:28:17] Harold 🔌⚡️: I’m so fucking hungry mehn wtf 😂
[13/01/2023, 01:29:40] Emeka🧠 Odedo: I sleep at 10pm to avoid midnight hunger
[13/01/2023, 01:30:19] Harold 🔌⚡️: Impressive
[13/01/2023, 01:30:27] Sean 👨🏽‍🎨 Patrick Nkwo: 💀
[13/01/2023, 01:30:34] Sean 👨🏽‍🎨 Patrick Nkwo: Why you still up?
[13/01/2023, 01:31:08] Sean 👨🏽‍🎨 Patrick Nkwo: I have a robotics assignment due by 3pm today
So imma be up till I get considerably far at the report
[13/01/2023, 01:31:10] Harold 🔌⚡️: Code/YouTube
[13/01/2023, 01:31:16] Sean 👨🏽‍🎨 Patrick Nkwo: Hard
[13/01/2023, 01:32:06] Sean 👨🏽‍🎨 Patrick Nkwo: Omo to avoid late night cravings 
Drink water
In severe cases you would eat a low calorie snack
Like fruits(I’d eat a bunch of pineapples)
[13/01/2023, 01:32:26] Harold 🔌⚡️: Oya now
[13/01/2023, 01:34:35] Sean 👨🏽‍🎨 Patrick Nkwo: But that’d be a lie
You are only hungry cuz you’re bored
If you keep yourself busy, you might forget your hunger

The ghrelin levels rise between 1-3
So if you can chest those times
You’ll be good

Ghrelin being the bodies hunger hormone
[13/01/2023, 01:35:02] Sean 👨🏽‍🎨 Patrick Nkwo: Usually cheating hunger for 30 mins gives you like 2-3 hrs of no hunger
[13/01/2023, 01:36:18] Sean 👨🏽‍🎨 Patrick Nkwo: And your body usually cries for food at times you are used to eating n and snacking

So if you know you used to eat late at night

You need to chest it and teach your body your new regimen
[13/01/2023, 12:48:32] Harold 🔌⚡️: 500 skips ✅

[13/01/2023, 23:22:36] Harold 🔌⚡️: It’s a simple thing.
baddies get approached more by senior men, get flown out, taken to clubs, spoilt, shit like that 

Hence they get used to the life, and keep living in it with different guys 

Ultimately leading them to become thots
[13/01/2023, 23:24:49] Sean 👨🏽‍🎨 Patrick Nkwo: Damn
[13/01/2023, 23:24:54] Sean 👨🏽‍🎨 Patrick Nkwo: That’s so real

But would you make her your gf
Or even take her out?
[13/01/2023, 23:25:47] Harold 🔌⚡️: Not a chance
[13/01/2023, 23:25:50] Sean 👨🏽‍🎨 Patrick Nkwo: Ultimately what kind of babe would you wife?

0 emotional investment and very minimal financial investment

So they might just see you as someone who is “doing to much” when you’re just treating them like a human”

I might get the occasional vid on my TL
But they might be talking about something associated with the vid, not the actual vid


So like I haven’t even gone out to type search or do a lil session to actively watch some shit

[17/01/2023, 10:36:16] Sean 👨🏽‍🎨 Patrick Nkwo: What’s the point of sharing this?

I’m asking, guys is it true that your body automatically dumps your tank for you after a certain amount of time

Because you didn’t nut at all in a certain time frame

I’m just tryna get guy’s opinion on the matter
[17/01/2023, 10:38:08] Harold 🔌⚡️: Omo e no easy

[22/01/2023, 21:54:53] Sean 👨🏽‍🎨 Patrick Nkwo: Omo I think in February I’ll experiment with eating 2000-2200 but do weight training frequently 
And frequently as 4-5 times a week
[22/01/2023, 21:55:08] Sean 👨🏽‍🎨 Patrick Nkwo: But honestly I don’t know how it will affect me
[22/01/2023, 21:55:24] Harold 🔌⚡️: Wtf 😂😂
[22/01/2023, 21:55:28] Harold 🔌⚡️: That’s insane
[22/01/2023, 21:55:48] Harold 🔌⚡️: Omo if you’re training like crazy and not eating carbs, you go big sha
[22/01/2023, 21:55:53] Sean 👨🏽‍🎨 Patrick Nkwo: They’re saying you get to eat more
But mostly protein 
You won’t be hungry 
But you need to be doing weight training 
And not much cardio
[22/01/2023, 21:56:05] Harold 🔌⚡️: I found out yesterday that losing weight and fat are two different things
[22/01/2023, 21:56:15] Sean 👨🏽‍🎨 Patrick Nkwo: He said he was eating carbs
But it was rice
And not doughnuts
[22/01/2023, 21:56:35] Sean 👨🏽‍🎨 Patrick Nkwo: Yh
Weight is on the scale
Fat is in the body composition
[22/01/2023, 21:56:50] Harold 🔌⚡️: Yeah

[22/01/2023, 21:57:10] Sean 👨🏽‍🎨 Patrick Nkwo: Bro, all I want is the abs, chest and arms

So whatever is the best and most sustainable way for that
I want to figure out
[22/01/2023, 21:57:19] Sean 👨🏽‍🎨 Patrick Nkwo: No bro
[22/01/2023, 21:57:37] Sean 👨🏽‍🎨 Patrick Nkwo: That’s extreme dieting
And with time the body will adapt
[22/01/2023, 21:59:00] Harold 🔌⚡️: For me ba on top of dropping weight I need to lose fat, really cut out carbs fr 

Like rn ba I can manage with not eating as much, but the carbs is literally impossible
[22/01/2023, 21:59:17] Harold 🔌⚡️: You sabi naija menu now 

Rice upon rice upon swallow upon yam
[22/01/2023, 21:59:21] Harold 🔌⚡️: Just carbs everywhere
[22/01/2023, 21:59:27] Sean 👨🏽‍🎨 Patrick Nkwo: The best way for you apparently 
Is to have more muscle mass
Muscle demands more energy to just exist on your body
So you burn the fat by just having it

Also caloric deficit means you are burning more than you eat

So if you eat protein
It’ll build the muscle mass
The mass burns the energy/calories

Fat is burnt for energy 

And so I’m
[22/01/2023, 22:00:01] Harold 🔌⚡️: I see
[22/01/2023, 22:00:16] Sean 👨🏽‍🎨 Patrick Nkwo: Carbs is energy 
It’s not bad
Just the amount in comparison to the protein

[31/01/2023, 12:14:02] Sean 👨🏽‍🎨 Patrick Nkwo: That’s the thing
You choose your 6-8hr window
[31/01/2023, 12:14:39] Sean 👨🏽‍🎨 Patrick Nkwo: Spags is like 700-1200 max
So you can really eat a good amount and not pass your calorie goal

[31/01/2023, 12:16:01] Sean 👨🏽‍🎨 Patrick Nkwo: That the thing
If you keep yourself busy and set an eating alarm
You’ll have to code your brain to say you are not hungry till it’s time to be hungry
[31/01/2023, 12:16:51] Sean 👨🏽‍🎨 Patrick Nkwo: And on the days when you are not at home
You might just need to count that day as rest day
Cuz you might not eat your goal
[31/01/2023, 12:17:07] Sean 👨🏽‍🎨 Patrick Nkwo: But once you master it for 1 week
It’s like clockwork from there
[31/01/2023, 12:17:59] Sean 👨🏽‍🎨 Patrick Nkwo: So chose your window
And set an alarm for when you’re allowed to eat
Then the hours outside that window
You just drink water and pray to God
[31/01/2023, 12:19:01] Harold 🔌⚡️: Fairs
[31/01/2023, 12:19:20] Harold 🔌⚡️: I ate by like 10 I guess I can still do it today
[31/01/2023, 12:19:25] Sean 👨🏽‍🎨 Patrick Nkwo: If you have fruits
You can indulge in them to fill you up

And if you’re really hungry outside the window
A banana or an apple won’t do too much

But it will end your fast sha
So your body will attack the fruit for energy and not your fat
[31/01/2023, 12:19:32] Sean 👨🏽‍🎨 Patrick Nkwo: Cool
[31/01/2023, 12:26:51] Harold 🔌⚡️: Na the fat I want attack I swear

You can use it for a short term masochistic session
But not in the long term
Just focus on eating more protein and counting your calories in a healthy manner

Find recipes that fit in your calorie meal goals
And equip them cuz you remember how many calories everything is roughly
