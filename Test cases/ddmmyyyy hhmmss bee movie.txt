[07/01/2023 14:10:45] Barry B. Benson: According to all known laws of aviation,
there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.
The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.
[07/01/2023, 14:10:53] Barry B. Benson: Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little.
[07012023, 14:11:16] Barry B. Benson: Barry! Breakfast is ready!
[07/01/23, 14:11:21] Barry B. Benson: Coming!
[07/01/2023, 14:11:42] Barry B. Benson: Hang on a second.
Hello? - Barry? - Adam?
[07/01/2023 14:11:47] Barry B. Benson: - Can you believe this is happening?
I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp.
[07/01/2023 14:17:09] Barry B. Benson: Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those.
[7/1/2023, 14:19:15] Barry B. Benson: Sorry. I'm excited.
Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son.
[07/01/2023, 14:19:23] Barry B. Benson: A perfect report card, all B's.
[07/01/2023, 14:19:34] Barry B. Benson: Very proud.
[07/01/2023 14:19:38] Barry B. Benson: Ma! I got a thing going here.
[07/01/2023, 14:20:04] Barry B. Benson: - You got lint on your fuzz.
Ow! That's me!
[07/01/2023, 14:20:10] Barry B. Benson: - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
Bye! - Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!
[07/01/2023, 14:20:25] Barry B. Benson: - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry.
- Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation.
[07/01/2023 14:21:00] Barry B. Benson: Never thought I'd make it.
[07/01/2023, 14:22:00 Barry B. Benson: Three days grade school, three days high school.
[07/01/2023, 14:23:00] Barry B. Benson: Those were awkward.
[07/01/2023, 14:23:30] Barry B. Benson: Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive.
[07/01/2023, 14:24:00] Barry B. Benson: You did come back different.
[07/01/2023, 14:24:30] Barry B. Benson: - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.
[07/01/2023, 14:25:00] Barry B. Benson: - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah.
[07/01/2023 14:25:30] Barry B. Benson: - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going.
[07/01/2023, 14:26:00] Barry B. Benson: Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.
Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead.
[07/01/2023, 14:26:30] Barry B. Benson: I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.
[07/01/2023, 14:27:00] Barry B. Benson: - I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.
[07/01/2023, 14:27:30] Barry B. Benson: That's why we don't need vacations.
[07/01/2023, 14:28:00] Barry B. Benson: Boy, quite a bit of pomp under the circumstances.
[07/01/2023, 14:28:30] Barry B. Benson: Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are! - Bee-men.
[07/01/2023, 14:29:00] Barry B. Benson: - Amen! - Hallelujah!

[07/01/2023, 14:35:30] Barry B. Benson: We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.
[07/01/2023, 14:36:00] Barry B. Benson: Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.
[07/01/2023, 14:36:30] Barry B. Benson: Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey!
[07/01/2023 14:37:00] Barry B. Benson: - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin!
[07/01/2023, 14:37:30] Barry B. Benson: She is? Yes, we're all cousins.
[07/01/2023, 14:38:00] Barry B. Benson: - Right. You're right.
[07/01/2023 14:38:30] Barry B. Benson: At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence.
[07/01/2023 14:39:00] Barry B. Benson: These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.

[07/01/2023 14:40:30] Barry B. Benson: - What does that do? - Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions.
[07/01/2023, 14:41:00] Barry B. Benson: - Can anyone work on the Krelman? - Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.
