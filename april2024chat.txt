[07/01/2023, 14:10:45] Sean!!: A year flies fast
[07/01/2023, 14:10:53] Sean!!: Faster than you can realise
[07/01/2023, 14:11:16] Sean!!: One second you’re saying happy new year
[07/01/2023, 14:11:21] Sean!!: Next you’re a week in
[07/01/2023, 14:11:42] Sean!!: And now you’ve just lost 1 out of 52 weeks in the year
[07/01/2023, 14:11:47] Sean!!: Just like that
[07/01/2023, 14:17:09] Sean!!: Ask yourself why you want to improve
[07/01/2023, 14:19:15] Sean!!: What are your goals
Set them
No matter how crazy they might sound
Or how intimidating
[07/01/2023, 14:19:23] Sean!!: And take it week by week
Day by day
[07/01/2023, 14:19:34] Sean!!: Love yourself
And emerge victorious!
[07/01/2023, 14:19:38] Sean!!: Let’s go!
[07/01/2023, 14:20:04] Sean!!: From Monday, you would just drop a ✅
For each day you met your goals
[07/01/2023, 14:20:10] Dike Slime🐍: !!!
[07/01/2023, 14:20:25] Dike Slime🐍: Let’s get this bread
[07/01/2023, 14:21:50] Dike Slime🐍: So what the plan basically for cutting ? 
Or we making our own plans and dropping the ✅ if we get them done ?
[07/01/2023, 14:24:05] Sean!!: My goals are to slightly build some muscle
But shred to nearly visible abs

I am not competing, so there’s no need for me to be at low body fat levels 

Just so my face can be low on fat, my jaw to be more visible, just to be shredded so I can take a shirtless pic in the summer time

These are personal reasons and I am proud of them

So should you!
[07/01/2023, 14:25:14] Sean!!: Yes
Your path
If you need help with your stuff
It will obviously be discussed here
We will motivate each other
And confess times where we feel like losing
Just raw bro energy
[07/01/2023, 14:26:02] Sean!!: But the concept is 
When we search ✅ in the chat

It will be full, like you will scroll with the amount of ✅
[07/01/2023, 14:26:30] Sean!!: So set realistic but ambitious goals
So you meet your targets at your desired times

[09/01/2023, 08:13:57] Sean!!: Yh it’ll be tough in Naij
Cuz here the calories are displayed on everything
[09/01/2023, 08:15:18] Sean!!: I’d say
If you watch YouTube eating plans
They’ll show you how much they eat in a day to lose weight
Like the gym guys oh
Not random Indian special apple vinegar tea videos

Like real ones talking about their meals
[09/01/2023, 08:16:13] Sean!!: But Omo it’s actually based on what you can endure
I’m 2022 I mostly ate chicken and eggs with lettuce & cabbage with bread as my carb source

And it worked out for me
[09/01/2023, 08:16:49] Sean!!: But if you’re someone that gets tired of eating the same meal, it might not be so easy to run my method
[09/01/2023, 08:18:04] Sean!!: I’d say watch YouTube and Tiktok for 
search 2000 calorie meal plan
Or 1800 meal plan

Or cutting diet

Or lean bull diet (if you’re looking to add muscle mass)
[09/01/2023, 08:18:47] Sean!!: But I swr
If you bang out
100 push-ups & 20-30 sit-ups everyday 

For a month
You’ll not be the same person
[09/01/2023, 09:45:13] Obi Slime🐍: my food intake isn’t that bad tbh

i skip meals a lot
[09/01/2023, 09:46:00] Obi Slime🐍: i was doing this for a while
i don’t mind tbh
[09/01/2023, 09:46:27] Obi Slime🐍: i don’t mind tbh
[09/01/2023, 09:46:43] Obi Slime🐍: i’m trying to lose fat
[09/01/2023, 09:46:59] Obi Slime🐍: i’m trying to get to that 100
[09/01/2023, 09:47:21] Obi Slime🐍: not the most athletic atm but we’ll get there
[09/01/2023, 09:47:36] Obi Slime🐍: i’m also starting badminton this wednesday
[09/01/2023, 10:14:25] Sean!!: Great
[09/01/2023, 10:14:39] Sean!!: Just weigh yourself
Then record your current weight
[09/01/2023, 10:15:21] Sean!!: Then try to eat 
At 1800-2000 calories a day
Weigh yourself at the end of the month
See if you stayed the same, reduced or added
[09/01/2023, 10:15:30] Sean!!: Tweak as you go
[09/01/2023, 10:16:37] Sean!!: Then, cut out bad things like frying your food in oil
Cuz oil has like 200 calories in a spoon Abi

Something in that insane ballpark 

Switch to 1 calorie spray oil
And lightly grill your food instead
[09/01/2023, 10:16:41] Sean!!: That helped
[09/01/2023, 10:17:35] Riri ⭐️: Drink water bro
[09/01/2023, 10:17:50] Riri ⭐️: For me ba, before I eat anything
[09/01/2023, 10:18:00] Riri ⭐️: I drink a lot of water, like a lot
[09/01/2023, 10:18:27] Riri ⭐️: Aspa like a lot, like 1.5 - 2L
[09/01/2023, 10:18:39] Riri ⭐️: Then I lose my appetite and I can only eat a little

[09/01/2023, 16:18:31] Obi Slime🐍: it’s because of boredom
[09/01/2023, 16:28:35] Riri ⭐️: Snacks Dey pack calories too bro
[09/01/2023, 16:28:43] Riri ⭐️: It will deceive you that it is light

[09/01/2023, 16:29:13] Riri ⭐️: Cashews, almond, ground nuts

[09/01/2023, 16:29:25] Riri ⭐️: A good alternative

[09/01/2023, 22:01:16] Sean!!: You think it’s too late to do a late night jog/run for 20 mins ?
It might help win some for today
[09/01/2023, 22:02:01] Riri ⭐️: I would have done this but I washed all my clothes in prep for my flight

[10/01/2023, 13:06:35] Sean!!: Any motivation is good enough to start

Then to keep going
You would’ve found yourself and confidence by maintaining your vessel

And that alone will serve as motivation cuz of self love
[10/01/2023, 13:08:30] Sean!!: You can use the fact that a babe did you dirty
Or they laughed at your body in school
Or that you watched anime and want to be like OPM or Baki
Or even because you want to become a personal trainer in the future
Or you want to attract one girl in your eye

Or because you want to surprise your family

Or you want to gain the respect of your father

Or want to fight for a girl in the village


Any And anything stands

[12/01/2023, 18:38:32] Emeka Slime🐍: There’s an app to track your weight??

Ate well
Added 24 squats and 24 ab crunches
[12/01/2023, 22:28:37] Riri ⭐️: Mad
[12/01/2023, 22:28:48] Riri ⭐️: Tomorrow hopefully I add skips
[12/01/2023, 23:00:54] Sean!!: Let’s go!
[13/01/2023, 00:28:17] Riri ⭐️: I’m so fucking hungry mehn wtf 😂
[13/01/2023, 00:29:40] Emeka Slime🐍: I sleep at 10pm to avoid midnight hunger
[13/01/2023, 00:30:19] Riri ⭐️: Impressive
[13/01/2023, 00:30:26] Sean!!: 💀
[13/01/2023, 00:30:34] Sean!!: Why you still up?
[13/01/2023, 00:31:08] Sean!!: I have a robotics assignment due by 3pm today
So imma be up till I get considerably far at the report
[13/01/2023, 00:31:10] Riri ⭐️: Code/YouTube
[13/01/2023, 00:31:16] Sean!!: Hard
[13/01/2023, 00:32:06] Sean!!: Omo to avoid late night cravings 
Drink water
In severe cases you would eat a low calorie snack
Like fruits(I’d eat a bunch of pineapples)
[13/01/2023, 00:32:26] Riri ⭐️: Oya now
[13/01/2023, 00:34:34] Sean!!: But that’d be a lie
You are only hungry cuz you’re bored
If you keep yourself busy, you might forget your hunger

The ghrelin levels rise between 1-3
So if you can chest those times
You’ll be good

Ghrelin being the bodies hunger hormone
[13/01/2023, 00:35:01] Sean!!: Usually cheating hunger for 30 mins gives you like 2-3 hrs of no hunger
[13/01/2023, 00:36:17] Sean!!: And your body usually cries for food at times you are used to eating n and snacking

So if you know you used to eat late at night

You need to chest it and teach your body your new regimen

Baddies are thots?
[13/01/2023, 22:21:31] Riri ⭐️: Most
[13/01/2023, 22:22:36] Riri ⭐️: It’s a simple thing.
baddies get approached more by senior men, get flown out, taken to clubs, spoilt, shit like that 

Hence they get used to the life, and keep living in it with different guys 

Ultimately leading them to become thots
[13/01/2023, 22:24:49] Sean!!: Damn
[13/01/2023, 22:24:54] Sean!!: That’s so real
[13/01/2023, 22:25:33] Sean!!: So you would hit a Thot
But would you make her your gf
Or even take her out?
[13/01/2023, 22:25:47] Riri ⭐️: Not a chance
[13/01/2023, 22:25:50] Sean!!: Ultimately what kind of babe would you wife?
[13/01/2023, 22:26:02] Riri ⭐️: I mean obv I’d hit
[13/01/2023, 22:26:40] Riri ⭐️: On the 1% chance I dated it would be for cruise 
0 emotional investment and very minimal financial investment
[13/01/2023, 22:27:30] Riri ⭐️: Nobody is perfect obv but someone that kind tick as many of my boxes as possible without having too many red flags

[13/01/2023, 22:31:09] Sean!!: Would you be yarning with such a person?

[13/01/2023, 22:34:33] Sean!!: Like they’re not dumb
But like they’ll not be used to somebody actually giving a fuck about them by even asking basic questions 

So they might just see you as someone who is “doing to much” when you’re just treating them like a human”

And find out I buss in real life

Just felt like a dream where I also just happened to see a bad bitch in between
[17/01/2023, 09:36:15] Sean!!: What’s the point of sharing this?

I’m asking, guys is it true that your body automatically dumps your tank for you after a certain amount of time

Because you didn’t nut at all in a certain time frame

I’m just tryna get guy’s opinion on the matter

[17/01/2023, 09:54:35] Sean!!: My brain just asking what the point of this

[22/01/2023, 20:53:26] Sean!!: I’m seeing talks about Jonathan Majors

[22/01/2023, 20:54:52] Sean!!: Omo I think in February I’ll experiment with eating 2000-2200 but do weight training frequently 
And frequently as 4-5 times a week
[22/01/2023, 20:55:08] Sean!!: But honestly I don’t know how it will affect me
[22/01/2023, 20:55:24] Riri ⭐️: Wtf 😂😂
[22/01/2023, 20:55:28] Riri ⭐️: That’s insane
[22/01/2023, 20:55:48] Riri ⭐️: Omo if you’re training like crazy and not eating carbs, you go big sha
[22/01/2023, 20:55:53] Sean!!: They’re saying you get to eat more
But mostly protein 
You won’t be hungry 
But you need to be doing weight training 
And not much cardio
[22/01/2023, 20:56:05] Riri ⭐️: I found out yesterday that losing weight and fat are two different things
[22/01/2023, 20:56:14] Sean!!: He said he was eating carbs
But it was rice
And not doughnuts
[22/01/2023, 20:56:34] Sean!!: Yh
Weight is on the scale
Fat is in the body composition
[22/01/2023, 20:56:50] Riri ⭐️: Yeah
‎[22/01/2023, 20:57:07] Riri ⭐️: ‎audio omitted
[22/01/2023, 20:57:10] Sean!!: Bro, all I want is the abs, chest and arms

So whatever is the best and most sustainable way for that
I want to figure out

[22/01/2023, 20:57:37] Sean!!: That’s extreme dieting
And with time the body will adapt
[22/01/2023, 20:59:00] Riri ⭐️: For me ba on top of dropping weight I need to lose fat, really cut out carbs fr 

Like rn ba I can manage with not eating as much, but the carbs is literally impossible
[22/01/2023, 20:59:17] Riri ⭐️: You sabi naija menu now 

Rice upon rice upon swallow upon yam
[22/01/2023, 20:59:21] Riri ⭐️: Just carbs everywhere
[22/01/2023, 20:59:27] Sean!!: The best way for you apparently 
Is to have more muscle mass
Muscle demands more energy to just exist on your body
So you burn the fat by just having it

Also caloric deficit means you are burning more than you eat

So if you eat protein
It’ll build the muscle mass
The mass burns the energy/calories

Fat is burnt for energy 

And so I’m
[22/01/2023, 21:00:01] Riri ⭐️: I see
[22/01/2023, 21:00:16] Sean!!: Carbs is energy 
It’s not bad
Just the amount in comparison to the protein

[23/01/2023, 19:06:14] Sean!!: The goal is just to motivate each other to work harder towards our goals
[23/01/2023, 19:07:28] Sean!!: As for the no eating p
I’m doing research this February sha
Cuz eating low amounts is gonna help
But I think eating more plus doing even more will still yield better results

Just that there’s no call to do insane amounts of work every fucking day

‎[31/01/2023, 11:13:11] Riri ⭐️: ‎audio omitted
[31/01/2023, 11:14:02] Sean!!: That’s the thing
You choose your 6-8hr window
[31/01/2023, 11:14:39] Sean!!: Spags is like 700-1200 max
So you can really eat a good amount and not pass your calorie goal

[31/01/2023, 11:15:42] Riri ⭐️: Omo e no easy I swear
[31/01/2023, 11:16:00] Sean!!: That the thing
If you keep yourself busy and set an eating alarm
You’ll have to code your brain to say you are not hungry till it’s time to be hungry
[31/01/2023, 11:16:50] Sean!!: And on the days when you are not at home
You might just need to count that day as rest day
Cuz you might not eat your goal
[31/01/2023, 11:17:06] Sean!!: But once you master it for 1 week
It’s like clockwork from there
[31/01/2023, 11:17:58] Sean!!: So chose your window
And set an alarm for when you’re allowed to eat
Then the hours outside that window
You just drink water and pray to God
[31/01/2023, 11:19:01] Riri ⭐️: Fairs
[31/01/2023, 11:19:20] Riri ⭐️: I ate by like 10 I guess I can still do it today
[31/01/2023, 11:19:24] Sean!!: If you have fruits
You can indulge in them to fill you up

And if you’re really hungry outside the window
A banana or an apple won’t do too much

But it will end your fast sha
So your body will attack the fruit for energy and not your fat
[31/01/2023, 11:19:31] Sean!!: Cool
[31/01/2023, 11:26:51] Riri ⭐️: Na the fat I want attack I swear

[31/01/2023, 12:05:14] Sean!!: You can do whatever extreme measures you want to lose all the excess weight 
Nobody will stop you

Just know you need to start building lifelong eating habits that will keep you healthy and at a desirable weight
[31/01/2023, 12:05:38] Sean!!: It’s not that
It’s just
Once you drop the weight
It’s so easy to gain it back if you didn’t learn how to eat properly

You can use it for a short term masochistic session
But not in the long term
Just focus on eating more protein and counting your calories in a healthy manner

Find recipes that fit in your calorie meal goals
And equip them cuz you remember how many calories everything is roughly

[31/03/2024, 21:32:15] Sean!!: Yes
It’s your gut bacteria adjusting to the food

Plus all these protein foods have a very high sulphuric index

So your farts just gonna smell different
[31/03/2024, 21:32:27] Obi Slime🐍: damn

[31/03/2024, 21:34:12] Sean!!: Nah I’m probably just remembering stuff from bios
[31/03/2024, 21:34:39] Sean!!: But in reality it’s most likely the gut reacting to the different food
[31/03/2024, 21:35:04] Sean!!: Plus different foods have a different effect when your body processing it
